### Digital Temperature sensor
#### Project Aim
Optimum temperature is very important for the function of various devices like car batteries, engines, complex circuits etc. The digital clock displays the temperature.     
#### Requirements
- 8051 microcontroller, LCD display  
- temperature sensor, LM35
#### Approach    
The temperature value from the sensor is analog. Hence, it is converted to digital value using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and then it is displayed.
