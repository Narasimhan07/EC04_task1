### RFID Based attendance system
#### Project Aim     
Taking attendance manually consumes more time. So, the proposed attendance system uses RFID technology to take attendance.   
#### Requirements
- Microcontroller
- RFID readers
- RFID tags
- LCD display      
#### Approach
RFID (Radio Frequency identification) based attendance system consists of RFID Reader, RFID Tag, LCD display and microcontroller unit.    
Data is transferred from RFID cards to reader and from there to microcontroller.     
The roll number of each student is displayed on the LCD screen.
Each tag that a different student recieves is unique.
