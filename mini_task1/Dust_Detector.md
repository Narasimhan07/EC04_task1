## Dust Detector using arduino and sensor
#### Aim 
The project determines the density of dust particles in the air using a sensor. This data is stored using the internet to be able to plot density using a graph. 
#### Requirements      
- Arduino, Arduino IDE
- GP2Y1014AU0F Dust Sensor
- ESP8266
- micro drip irrigation sysytem
#### Approach     
- The dust sensor used IR LED to measure the intensity of light scattered by the dust particles. The more the dust particles greater is the scattering.
- This intensity which is recorded is converted into a voltage signal which is further converted in terms of dust density.
