### 5 Channel IR Remote
#### Project Aim
To design a 5 channel IR remote     
#### Approach
The circuit works on the principle of IR communication. IR communication involves transmitting signals using infrared signal as the carrier. The input signal from switches is
processed by the microcontroller, encoded by the encoder, modulated and transmitted by the transmitter. At the receiver, the modulated signal is demodulated by the IR receiver, 
decoded by the decoder and processed by the microcontroller to control the output loads.
