### Webcam Privacy   
#### Aim    
The aim of this project is to build a feature that can cover the camera of a webam when the user wants to. It also allows the user to fix a time duration for which the camera 
remains open.   
#### Requirements

#### Approach    
- The pushbutton facility is to immeadiately block the camera when the user wants to.    
- The openning and closing of the camera is controlled using the servo motor arm.   
- A potentiometer is used to add the timed feature. The potentiometer brings in an analog reading which is programmed to translate to a number of minutes, after which the 
eyelid is programmed to close and cover the webcam.    
- However, the eyelid can still be abruptly closed using a pushbutton.
