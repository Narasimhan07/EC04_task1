#### Working   
This circuit is based on the principle of driving LEDs using the clock pulses. The idea is to make the cube glow in gradual transition from one set of trio to each face of the
cube to the whole cube itself. This is achieved by using two counters such that the first counter comes to play for first nine pulses and each of the trio of LEDs glow for each 
pulse. The second counter comes to play from the 10th pulse and each face of the cube starts glowing.
