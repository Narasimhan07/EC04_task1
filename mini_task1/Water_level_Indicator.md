#### Approach
The sensing is done by using a set of nine probes which are placed at nine different levels on the tank walls.
The circuit is based on iterative yes/no conditions.   
The microcontroller checks for tank full condition, if the condition is satisfied it indicates the same on display unit and also sounds a buzzer if the condition fails it checks 
again and this process continues and the corresponding level is indicated in the display unit.
