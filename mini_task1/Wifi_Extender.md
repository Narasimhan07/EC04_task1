Difficulties due to poor wifi connectivity is a common problem. For many people, wifi speed is hugely reduced even if the router is just a room away. The Wifi extender is cost 
effective compared to a repeater and easy to set up.   
#### Hardware   
- Raspberry pi microprocessor
- peripherals to set up the system
#### Approach
once Pi is set up, we need to install some pre-requisite files using the OS on the terminal.  
Once the services are configured, wifi name and password has to be set up.   
Then any device can be connected to the wifi network.
